# Upgrading to v3

On March 24, 2022, Clerk launched Version 3 of its full suite of Javascript libraries, including our SDKs for React, Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, and Redwood. This guide helps developers upgrade from Version 2 to Version 3.

Need help with the migration? Feel free to [reach out to us](https://clerk.com/support).

## Why upgrade?

Version 3 includes a number of bug fixes, developer experience improvements, and altogether new features, including:

- Support for server-side rendering
- Reduced React re-renders
- Improved Typescript types and IntelliSense autocomplete

## Upgrade your client-side code

To get started with the upgrade, you'll need to upgrade your dependencies.
